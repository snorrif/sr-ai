According to Yamaha’s own “standard bolt torque” guidelines (as applied in the Raptor 700 service manual), M10 frame-to-frame bolts on the Raptor typically call for right around 40 N·m (which is about 29 lb ft). In many Yamaha manuals, M10 fasteners without a special/unique listing default to this 40 N·m figure.
So for the four M10 bolts attaching the rear subframe (rear frame) to the main (middle) frame on a 2007 Raptor 700, the recommended torque is:
40 N·m (29 lb ft)
If you have an official Yamaha manual for your exact model/year, it may list this under a “standard torque chart” or “chassis tightening torques” section; but in all cases, you will find that M10 frame bolts default to approximately 40 N·m (29 lb ft) unless otherwise specified.

Below are the commonly referenced torque specifications for the 2007 Kawasaki KX125 two-stroke cylinder head bolts (sometimes referred to as cylinder head nuts):
• Torque: 25 N·m (2.5 kgf·m, 18 ft·lb)
General Tips:
• Tighten the head bolts in a crisscross (diagonal) pattern.
• It’s good practice to tighten in two stages (for example, half the final torque first, then the full torque).
• Always use a calibrated torque wrench and follow the manufacturer’s sequence to avoid warping the head.
• Consult the official Kawasaki Service Manual for additional details such as tightening order, lubricants, and any model-specific updates.

Below are the commonly referenced figures for the 2010 CRF250R cylinder head bolts. Always cross-check with an official Honda Service Manual or a trusted source to ensure accuracy for your specific engine and to confirm any revision updates.

Main (8 mm) Cylinder Head Bolts (“Bolt A” in many manuals):
• Torque in two stages:
– First to about 20 N·m (14–15 ft·lb)


– Then final torque to 44 N·m (32–33 ft·lb)

Smaller (6 mm) Cylinder Head Bolts (“Bolt B”):
• 10–12 N·m (7–9 ft·lb)


General Tips:
• Tighten in a crisscross or diagonal pattern as shown in the service manual.


• Check that all washers/gaskets and the seating surfaces are clean.


• Lightly oil the bolt threads (as recommended by Honda) before torquing.


• Recheck torque after the engine has gone through a few heat cycles if directed by the manual.
Because specifications can differ slightly by production run and region, it is safest to confirm that these figures match the latest official Honda documentation for your exact model/year.

According to the 2006 Suzuki RM-Z450 service documentation, the swingarm pivot bolt (pivot nut) is typically torqued to about 80 N·m (approximately 59 ft‑lb). As always, it is best to verify this specification via the official factory service manual for your precise model year to ensure accuracy and account for any model‑specific updates or revisions.

REF 5

According to KTM’s specifications for the 2015 250 SX‑F, the recommended torque for the front axle pinch bolts is 17 N·m (approximately 12.5 ft·lb). Always verify you are consulting the correct model-year manual, and use a calibrated torque wrench to ensure accuracy. If in doubt, contact a KTM dealer or qualified technician.


REF 6

According to the Yamaha service documentation, the recommended torque for each of the rear sprocket bolts (nuts) on a 2012 YZ450F is 47 N·m (34 lb·ft). Yamaha also typically recommends using a medium-strength threadlocker (e.g., Loctite® 243 or similar) on the threads before tightening.
Quick tips:
• Make sure the bolt threads and sprocket mounting surfaces are clean and free of old threadlocker.


• Apply the new threadlocker to the clean threads.


• Tighten in a crisscross pattern to ensure even torque.


• Double-check the torque after you have tightened all bolts.
Always refer to your Yamaha owner’s or service manual for the most accurate and up-to-date information specific to your vehicle.

According to the Kawasaki factory specifications, the clutch cover bolts on a 2009 KX250F should be tightened to about 8.8 N·m (78 in·lb), which is roughly 6.5 ft·lb. Always tighten in a crisscross pattern and use a calibrated torque wrench to avoid over‐ or under‐tightening.


REF 8

According to the factory service information for a 2004 Suzuki DR-Z400E, the valve cover (cylinder head cover) bolts should be torqued to approximately 10 N·m (7.0 lb·ft). Always follow a crisscross pattern when tightening those bolts to ensure even seating of the cover gasket. As with any repair, it is best to consult the official service manual for your specific model year and local specifications to confirm.

REF 9 

According to KTM’s service literature for the 2017–2019 250/300 EXC models (which share the same engine architecture), the cylinder base nuts (M8) are typically torqued to 25 N·m (about 18 ft‑lb). When reinstalling or servicing your cylinder, it’s a good idea to:
• Ensure threads are clean and lightly oiled (if the manual specifies).


• Tighten in a star or crisscross pattern to apply even clamping force.


• Use a calibrated torque wrench for accuracy.
Because equipment can vary and KTM may update specifications, it’s always best to confirm these values with the official KTM service manual for your exact year and model.

REF 10

According to the Honda Service Manual for the 2003 CR125R, the recommended torques for the triple clamp pinch bolts are typically:
• Upper clamp pinch bolts: 20 N·m (approximately 14–15 ft·lb)


• Lower clamp pinch bolts: 25 N·m (approximately 18 ft·lb)
Always use a reliable, calibrated torque wrench and tighten in a crisscross pattern to ensure even clamping on the fork tubes. If you don’t have the official manual, it’s wise to confirm these values with a reputable source to avoid overtightening or undertightening.
