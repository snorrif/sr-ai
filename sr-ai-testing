the four M10 bolts that secure the rear part of the frame (middle frame and rear frame connection) on a 2007 Yamaha Raptor 700 should be tightened to 54 Nm (39 ft-lb).

Make sure to tighten these bolts in the recommended sequence and use a calibrated torque wrench for accurate results.

For the 2007 Kawasaki KX125, the torque settings are:

• Cylinder Head Nuts (M9): 25 Nm (2.5 kgf·m, 18 ft·lb)
• Cylinder Head Bolts (M6): 12 Nm (1.2 kgf·m, 106 in·lb)

Please note that if your Kawasaki 125 model is different (for example, a Ninja 125 or KLX125), these specifications might vary. It's always best to verify with the official service manual for your specific model and use a calibrated torque wrench during assembly.

For the 2010 Honda CRF250R, the cylinder head assembly uses several types of fasteners with different torque requirements. Here’s a summary of the torque specifications and recommended tightening procedure:

• Cylinder Head Stud Bolts (Larger Fasteners): 29 ft-lbs (39 Nm)
• Smaller Cylinder Head Bolts (Left Side) and 6mm Cylinder Bolts: 7 ft-lbs (9.8 Nm)
• Cam Tower Bolts: 12 ft-lbs (16.3 Nm)

Tightening Procedure: • For the larger cylinder head stud bolts, use a crisscross tightening pattern over two or three stages. For example, you might begin with an initial pass at about 10 ft-lbs, then a second pass at approximately 20 ft-lbs, and finally tighten to the full 29 ft-lbs.
• Once the larger bolts are set, tighten the smaller cylinder head bolts (and 6mm bolts) to 7 ft-lbs.
• Lastly, tighten the cam tower bolts in a similar, staged crisscross manner to ensure even pressure distribution.

Always use a calibrated torque wrench and ensure that all bolt threads and seating surfaces are clean and lightly lubricated before assembly. This helps achieve accurate torque readings and prevents potential damage due to over- or under-tightening.	

REF 4
For the 2006 Suzuki RM-Z450, the official service manual specifies a torque setting of 70 N·m (which is equivalent to 7.0 kgf-m or approximately 50.5 lb-ft) for the swingarm pivot bolt (noting that it may sometimes be referred to as the swingarm pivot shaft nut).

Make sure the bolt and its seating area are clean and properly lubricated prior to assembly, and always use a calibrated torque wrench to achieve the correct torque. If you have any additional questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

REF 5

For the 2015 KTM 250 SX-F, the official torque specification for the front axle pinch bolts (M8) is 15 Nm (about 11.1 lb-ft).

Be sure to consult the official KTM service manual for any additional recommendations or procedures, and always use a calibrated torque wrench to achieve accurate results.

REF 6

For the 2012 Yamaha YZ450F, the torque specification for the rear wheel sprocket nuts is 42 Nm (which is approximately 4.2 m·kg or 30 ft·lbs).

A few key points to keep in mind when working on this assembly: • Always tighten the nuts in stages and use a crisscross pattern to ensure even pressure distribution. • Using a calibrated torque wrench will help in applying the exact torque. • It’s a good idea to consult the official Yamaha service manual for any additional procedural details or recommendations.

REF 7 

For a 2009 Kawasaki KX250F, the correct torque for the clutch cover bolts is 87 in-lbs (about 9.8 N·m).

Additional tips for a proper installation: • The clutch cover is typically secured with five 6mm bolts. • Always use a calibrated torque wrench to ensure accuracy. • Tighten the bolts in a star (or cross) pattern, gradually increasing the torque in stages to ensure even pressure distribution. • Avoid over-torqueing, as this could strip the engine case threads. • Generally, thread locker (Loctite) is not required for these bolts unless specified otherwise by the manufacturer.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!


REF 8 
Based on the provided web-scraped data, the tightening torque for the cylinder head cover (valve cover) bolts on a Suzuki DR-Z400S is 14 N·m (1.4 kgf-m). Since the DR-Z400E (2004) typically shares the same engine with the DR-Z400S, it’s likely that the valve cover bolts on the DR-Z400E also require a torque of 14 N·m.

A few points to ensure a proper installation: • Use a calibrated torque wrench to ensure accurate bolt tightening. • Follow the recommended tightening sequence (often a cross or star pattern) to ensure even pressure across the cover. • Always verify with your vehicle’s official service manual if possible, as variations can occur between model years or due to specific manufacturing details.

If you have further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask!

REF 9

Based on the available data, the torque specification for the cylinder base nuts (M10) on a KTM 300 EXC (2018) is 35 Nm. Although a specific tightening sequence isn’t clearly detailed in the available snippets, it's generally recommended to tighten these nuts in a criss-cross (or criss-cross-like) pattern to ensure even pressure distribution.

When performing the procedure, be sure to use a calibrated torque wrench for accuracy and follow the manufacturer's guidelines, confirming with the service manual if possible.

REF 10

For the 2003 Honda CR125R, the recommended torque for the triple clamp pinch bolts is as follows:

• Upper clamp bolts: 16 ft-lbs (22 Nm)
• Lower clamp bolts: 14 ft-lbs (19 Nm)

When installing, tighten the bolts gradually in stages using a crisscross pattern to ensure even clamping force. This method helps prevent binding and potential damage to the forks. As always, it’s best to use a calibrated torque wrench and, if possible, confirm these values with your official service manual.
